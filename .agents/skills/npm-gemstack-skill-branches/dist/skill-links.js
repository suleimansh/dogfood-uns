 * The skill, where the agent's harness looks for one (#1739). A harness discovers skills under a
 * directory of its own at the checkout root — `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Claude Code,
 * `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Codex — and a checkout under `.branches/` is its own
 * repository root to it, so nothing the project keeps in those directories reaches the agent.
 * Every checkout the package creates therefore gets one symlink per harness, named as the skill
 * and pointing at this package, whose `SKILL.md` is the skill. One mechanism for every harness,
 * and the same text for every agent; a new harness is one more entry in {@link HARNESS_SKILL_DIRS}.
