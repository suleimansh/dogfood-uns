/**
 * Give a fresh worktree a dependency tree (#736). `node_modules` is gitignored, so
 * `git worktree add` hands the agent an empty one and every command in it fails.
 *
 * Three ways to fix that: copy the tree (correct, but gigabytes per agent), install
 * into each worktree (correct, but real latency on every start), or link the
 * parent checkout's trees in (instant, no extra disk, one store shared by N runs).
 * We link — but each *entry* of a dependency directory, into a real directory of
 * the worktree's own, never the directory itself (#1262). A directory link made the
 * parent's tree the worktree's modules directory in the package manager's eyes:
 * an agent that changed a dependency and ran `pnpm install` had pnpm resolve
 * through the link and rewrite — or, under `CI=true`, purge outright — the parent
 * checkout's real `node_modules`, and every later agent died at boot. With a real
 * directory holding links, an install in the worktree writes into the worktree.
 *
 * The package manager's own state (`.pnpm`, `.modules.yaml`, and the like — every
 * dot-entry but `.bin`) is deliberately not linked: it is what tells the package
 * manager "this tree is mine, installed here", and the worktree's is not. The
 * packages still resolve without it — a package entry in a pnpm tree is a relative
 * link into `.pnpm`, and a link to that link resolves where the target lives, in
 * the parent checkout. `.bin` is linked because an agent runs the project's tools.
