# Tickets

The tickets (`tickets/<DATE>_<SLUG>.md`, with their `.plan.md` and `.lock.md` siblings) live on the branch `agent-data`, never on a code branch. A `tickets` link at the repository root, if present, shows a possibly stale copy; never write there. The command reads fresh.

Read and change them with the `tickets` command, a dependency of this repository (`@gemstack/skill-tickets`), run as `npx tickets`. When that fails for a missing `node_modules`, install with the lockfile's package manager (`npm install` for `package-lock.json`) and run it again. Every change it makes is one commit pushed straight to the `agent-data` branch. A refusal exits 1 with a line on stderr; a wrong command line exits 2 with the usage.

## Read

```
npx tickets list                 every open ticket, as one JSON array: file, title, summary, priority, topics,
                                 github, date, planned, effort, uncertainty, locked, lockedBy
                                 (priority, topics, github, effort, uncertainty, locked, lockedBy
                                 absent when unset)
npx tickets show <file>          one ticket: its text, its plan, who holds it
```

## Change

```
npx tickets put <file>           write one file under tickets/ from stdin, the whole file, creating it if new;
                                 empty stdin writes an empty file
                                 (npx tickets put <file> < draft.md): a ticket or a plan
npx tickets close <file>         once the work is done and published: remove the ticket with its plan
                                 and lock; refused while someone else holds it; its queue entry, if any,
                                 stays: `npx queue done` it
```

## Queue a ticket

When the repository has the `queue` skill, a ticket goes on the agent queue as a link, its title as the label, at the ticket's own `Priority:` (5 when it has none):

```
npx queue add "[<title>](tickets/<file>)" --priority <N>
```

Once the work is done and published, `npx tickets close <file>` and `npx queue done` the entry.

## Claim before you plan or work a ticket

```
npx tickets claim <file>         {"ok":true,"file":…,"holder":…} — the ticket is yours
                                 {"ok":false,"reason":"claimed","holder":…,"file":…} — someone else's
                                 (no holder when the lock's line does not parse): pick another; never remove
                                 or overwrite their lock. A claim guards claim, close and release;
                                 put overwrites whoever holds the ticket
npx tickets release <file>       lift your own claim when the plan or the work is done, and before you
                                 stop unless you closed it; nothing lifts it on a timeout
```

Every `<file>` above takes a ticket's filename (`2042-01-01_some-ticket.md`) or the `tickets/…` path a queue entry links to; `put` also takes that ticket's `.plan.md` name, and writes a plan for a ticket that does not exist, without complaint, invisible to `show`. You claim as `AGENT_ID` when it is set, else as your current branch (so a rename or a branch switch between claim and release changes who you are: release from the branch you claimed on, or the lock stays until a person edits the branch).

## Formats

### A ticket: `tickets/<DATE>_<SLUG>.md`

DATE: yyyy-mm-dd. SLUG: a succinct kebab-case slug of the ticket title.

```md
Priority: 0-10 [optional, 10: critical — act immediately, 0: only if capacity]
Topics: [list-of-topics] [optional]
GitHub: [#42](https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42) [optional]

# Ticket title

## TLDR

...

## Why it matters

...

[optional: more info (any heading and format you want)]
```

`Priority:`, `Effort:` and `Uncertainty:` are bare whole numbers above the `# ` title; anything else reads as absent for queue placement and the scales, and a ticket with no readable `Priority:` queues at 5.

### A claim: `tickets/<DATE>_<SLUG>.lock.md`

Written by `npx tickets claim`, removed by `npx tickets release` or `npx tickets close`. One line: `CLAIMED: <holder>`.

### A plan: `tickets/<DATE>_<SLUG>.plan.md`

The plan for an existing ticket (`tickets/2042-01-01_some-ticket.md` → `tickets/2042-01-01_some-ticket.plan.md`).

```md
Effort: 0-10 [0: implementation is trivial, 10: implementation takes months]
Uncertainty: 0-10 [0: implementation without meaningful alternatives, 10: highly uncertain how to implement]
Outdated: yes [optional, only if the ticket was updated in a way that makes the plan outdated]

# [Plan] Ticket title

Single sentence describing this file's content.

## TLDR [optional]

Brief overview of this file's content.

## Problems [optional]

List of all significant aspects with low confidence on how to implement, with explanation why uncertain.

## Solutions [optional]

For each problem, list of ways to solve the problem (including meaningful shortcuts, for quicker implementation).

## Considerations [optional]

Exhaustive list of all significant aspects to be considered (including edge cases).

## Implementation [optional]

Concrete plan to implement the ticket.
```

Notes:
- Covers both spiking (e.g. high-level research without implementation plan) and planning (e.g. concrete implementation proposal)
- The `.plan.md` file can be modified multiple times over an extended period (e.g. a ticket requiring repeated human intervention, transitioning from spiking to concrete plan)
- All sections are just proposals and optional: you can use any headings with any format
- The uncertainty value:
  - Gauges whether there are *significant* alternatives, minor variability such as syntax should be ignored
  - Is used for evaluating whether human intervention is needed (0 => clearly no human intervention needed)
- Example of how to gauge uncertainty and alternatives:
  - List all aspects that need to be considered
  - Give an uncertainty rating (0-10) to each aspect following this criteria: is there an obviously optimal way to implement it (0), or is it highly unclear whether it can be implemented in a better way (10)?
  - Explore and suggest alternatives for each aspect with a low rating
